# Detailed Plan for Fixing Expo iOS Launch and Bundling Issues

This plan outlines step-by-step changes and verifications across dependent files to ensure that your Expo app runs on iOS and avoids unwanted web bundling errors.

---

## 1. Verify and Set Working Directory

- **Issue:** The web bundling error arises from running commands in the wrong project folder.
- **Action:** 
  - **Navigate to the Expo project folder:**  
    Open your terminal and run:  
    cd UberClone
  - **Use Expo CLI commands from within the UberClone directory** to prevent interference from the root Next.js/web configuration.

---

## 2. Modify UberClone/app.json

- **Objective:** Configure Expo to bundle only for iOS and Android.
- **Changes:**
  - Open `UberClone/app.json`.
  - Under the `"expo"` key, add or update the `"platforms"` property to include only `"ios"` and `"android"`. This will prevent Expo from attempting to bundle for web.
  - **Example Update:**
    ```json
    {
      "expo": {
        "name": "UberClone",
        "slug": "uberclone",
        "platforms": ["ios", "android"],
        "sdkVersion": "48.0.0",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "orientation": "portrait",
        "icon": "./assets/icon.png",
        "splash": {
          "image": "./assets/splash-icon.png",
          "resizeMode": "contain",
          "backgroundColor": "#ffffff"
        },
        "updates": {
          "fallbackToCacheTimeout": 0
        },
        "assetBundlePatterns": [
          "**/*"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
- **Error Handling:**  
  If Expo still shows a bundling error, re-run `expo diagnostics` and check for misconfiguration messages.

---

## 3. Update UberClone/package.json Scripts

- **Objective:** Ensure that there is a dedicated command to launch the app in iOS Simulator.
- **Changes:**
  - Open `UberClone/package.json`.
  - In the `"scripts"` section, add a new script to start Expo with iOS targeting:
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start": "expo start",
        "start:ios": "expo start --ios",
        "start:android": "expo start --android"
      }
    }
    ```
- **Best Practices:**  
  Confirm that dependencies include the required Expo packages and that no scripts inadvertently trigger the Next.js/web bundler.

---

## 4. Review UberClone/App.js

- **Objective:** Ensure the main component is correctly structured for Expo.
- **Actions:**
  - Open `UberClone/App.js`.
  - Verify that it includes a default exported component, for example:
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text>Welcome to UberClone!</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }

    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center'
      }
    });
    ```
  - **Error Handling:**  
    Add try-catch logic or error boundaries if you anticipate runtime exceptions. Log any errors for easier debugging.

---

## 5. Testing and Verification

- **Run the iOS Simulator:**
  - In the terminal (while in the UberClone directory), run:  
    npm run start:ios  
  - Verify that the iOS Simulator launches and the app preview appears.
- **Additional Diagnostics:**
  - If the bundling error persists, use `expo diagnostics` and check console logs for guidance.
  - Verify that no Expo commands are being inadvertently executed from the root folder containing Next.js configuration.

---

## 6. Root Project Considerations

- **Insight:**  
  Since your workspace also contains a Next.js (web) project, ensure you are not confusing the bundling process by running Expo commands from the root. Always target the UberClone folder for iOS/Android testing.
- **Action:**  
  If necessary, update the root package.json scripts to clearly differentiate commands for the Next.js app and the Expo app.

---

## Summary

- Navigate into the `UberClone` folder to run Expo commands.  
- Update `UberClone/app.json` to specify only `"ios"` and `"android"` platforms, excluding web.  
- Add a dedicated `"start:ios"` script in `UberClone/package.json` to automatically launch the iOS simulator.  
- Verify that `UberClone/App.js` exports a proper React Native component and includes error handling if needed.  
- Test using `npm run start:ios` and utilize `expo diagnostics` for further error insights.  
- Ensure no conflicts are caused by the overlapping Next.js project in the root directory.
